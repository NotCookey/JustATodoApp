## About
- **It's a Todo App that I wrote, and it's my first time developing a full-stack application with Flask. It's possible that it has multiple bugs, since I didn't thoroughly test it. Limiters or rate limitations are built into the routes and endpoints to avoid abuse. You can create or add additional Todos, but I haven't implemented [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD) entirely yet, but I may do so in the future since I'm still learning fullstack development.**

## Can I Use The Code?
- **Yes! of course you are free to use, share, modify the code as you please. The project is under the MIT License and is Open-Source in every way. So Feel Free!**
